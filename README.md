# üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Atlassian MCP Server architecture using the C4 Model (Context, Containers, Components, and Code). The C4 Model is a lean graphical notation technique for modeling the architecture of software systems, created by Simon Brown. It provides a structured approach to visualizing software architecture at different levels of abstraction.

## Architecture Overview Using C4 Model

The C4 Model helps us communicate software architecture effectively by providing four different levels of abstraction:

- **Level 1 - System Context**: Shows the software system in scope and its relationship with users and other software systems
- **Level 2 - Container**: Shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it
- **Level 3 - Component**: Shows how a container is made up of components, their responsibilities and technology/implementation details
- **Level 4 - Code**: Shows how a component is implemented at the code level (typically UML class diagrams)

## Context Diagram (C4 Level 1)

### Purpose
The Context Diagram provides a high-level view of the Atlassian MCP Server system and its interactions with external actors and systems. This diagram establishes the system boundary and shows who uses the system and what other systems it interacts with.

### Key Elements
- **Primary Actors**: Development environments including VS Code and Visual Studio that serve as the primary interfaces for developers
- **AI Integration**: Large Language Models (LLMs) that provide intelligent assistance and automation capabilities
- **External Integrations**: Atlassian services and APIs that the MCP Server communicates with to manage project data
- **System Boundary**: Clearly defines what is inside the MCP Server system versus external dependencies

This diagram helps stakeholders understand the overall ecosystem in which the Atlassian MCP Server operates and its role in the broader development workflow.

## Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

### Purpose
The Container Diagram represents the high-level technical architecture of the Atlassian MCP Server, showing the major containers (applications, services, databases) that make up the system and how they communicate with each other.

### Architecture Highlights
- **Modular Design**: The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainability and scalability
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Different containers handle specific responsibilities such as authentication, data processing, and API management
- **Communication Patterns**: Shows the protocols and interfaces used for inter-container communication
- **Technology Stack**: Illustrates the key technologies and frameworks used in each container

This level provides development teams with the information needed to understand the overall system structure and make informed decisions about deployment, scaling, and integration strategies.

## Component Diagram (C4 Level 3)

### Purpose
The Component Diagram provides a detailed view of the internal structure of the main MCP Server container, showing the key components, their responsibilities, and how they collaborate to deliver the system's functionality.

### Component Architecture
- **Authentication Components**: Handle secure authentication with Atlassian services and manage user sessions
- **API Gateway Components**: Manage incoming requests, routing, and response formatting
- **Business Logic Components**: Implement core functionality for JIRA integration, issue management, and project operations
- **Data Access Components**: Manage communication with external APIs and data transformation
- **Utility Components**: Provide cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, and configuration management

### Benefits
This detailed component view enables developers to:
- Understand the internal architecture and component responsibilities
- Make informed decisions about code organization and module boundaries
- Plan refactoring efforts and identify potential areas for optimization
- Facilitate onboarding of new team members by providing clear architectural guidance

## Sequence Diagram
![MCP (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a45c6461-99e5-4bbf-8b45-e35a115b73ef)

### Purpose
The Sequence Diagram illustrates the dynamic behavior of the system by showing how different components and external systems interact over time to accomplish specific use cases or workflows.

### Workflow Representation
This diagram captures the temporal aspects of system interactions, including:
- **Request/Response Flow**: How requests flow through the system from initiation to completion
- **Component Interaction**: The sequence of calls between internal components
- **External API Calls**: Communication patterns with Atlassian services and other external systems
- **Error Handling**: How the system responds to various error conditions and edge cases
- **Lifecycle Management**: The complete workflow from request initiation to final response delivery

### Value for Development
Understanding these interaction patterns helps developers:
- Debug complex workflows by following the sequence of operations
- Optimize performance by identifying bottlenecks in the interaction flow
- Ensure proper error handling and system resilience
- Design effective testing strategies that cover critical interaction paths
